# Example applications

In order to see the Java SDK in action you can check out following example applications that we created over time:

- [aens-name-claimer](https://github.com/kryptokrauts/aens-name-claimer)
    - This application can be used to claim and (auto-) extend multiple names.
    We used this application back then in 2019 to perform the [first AENS claim ever](https://kryptokrauts.com/log/first-claim-ever-of-an-aens-name) on æternity!
- [ae-prediction-cards](https://github.com/kryptokrauts/ae-prediction-cards)
    - This application has been created during the [Akshwani Haeck](https://akshwanihaeck.devpost.com) and has been awarded with ***Best æ oracles based DeFI application***.
- [aepp-showcase-android](https://github.com/kryptokrauts/aepp-showcase-android)
    - This is a very simple showcase how the SDK can be used in an Android application.
- [contraect-showcase-maven](https://github.com/kryptokrauts/contraect-showcase-maven)
    - This repository showcases how to use the [contraect-maven-plugin](https://github.com/kryptokrauts/contraect-maven-plugin) to easily interact with smart contracts in Java.
    One of the examples is a MultiSig contract to be used with the [Generalized Accounts](https://aeternity.com/protocol/generalized_accounts/ga_explained.html) feature.
    
In addition to the examples above the Java SDK is being used to integrate æternity into [venly](https://venly.io) (formerly known as ArkaneNetwork) since early 2020! You can take a look at the implementation [here](https://github.com/ArkaneNetwork/blockchain-providers/tree/develop/provider-aeternity).
