To provide an easy way to interact with smart contracts on the Ã¦ternity blockchain we developed a plugin that uses the source code of contracts written in Sophia as input to generate Java classes. The generated classes make use of the aepp-sdk-java and provide methods to deploy contracts and call the respective entrypoint functions.
